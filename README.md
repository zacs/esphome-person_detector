# esphome-person_detector

On-device human-presence detection for ESPHome.

`person_detect` is a general-purpose ESPHome external component that uses a
camera to decide whether a person is in frame — presence only, not identity —
entirely on-device, and exposes it to Home Assistant as an occupancy
`binary_sensor`.

It's built to be portable and extended: the detection model, the camera sensor,
the frame-source backend, and the target SoC are all swappable (see
[Extending](#extending) and [Portability](#portability)). The Seeed Studio
reTerminal D1001 (ESP32-P4 + MIPI-CSI SC2356) is simply the first board that's
been verified end-to-end on hardware — a starting point, not the purpose. Other
ESP-DL targets, such as an ESP32-S3 with a DVP camera, fit the same design; they
work today and just need verifying.

## Privacy

Nothing leaves the device. There's no cloud API, no companion server, and no
streaming to Home Assistant — all inference runs locally. It uses no
face-recognition models and stores no biometric data; it answers one question,
"is a person in frame right now?", and nothing else. An optional `switch` turns
detection on and off: on is the default, and turning it off releases the camera
and stops all inference, so flipping it off gives you a hard privacy cut.

## The model

Detection uses Espressif's
[`pedestrian_detect`](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/pedestrian_detect)
model (v0.3.0), built on [ESP-DL](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dl),
Espressif's on-device deep-learning library. It's an INT8-quantized full-body
pedestrian detector with a 224×224×3 input, pulled in automatically by the
ESP-IDF component manager — you don't fetch or embed anything by hand.

Two practical consequences worth knowing:

- It looks for whole standing or walking people, not faces. A close-up of your
  face may not trigger it, but a person standing in the room will — so aim the
  camera to see bodies, not head-and-shoulders.
- Inference takes about 75 ms on the ESP32-P4 (it also runs on the S3, slower).

The model is swappable: the `model:` key on `person_detect` selects it, and any
ESP-DL detector that returns `dl::detect::result_t` boxes can be added — see
[Extending](#extending).

## Requirements

The detector runs anywhere ESP-DL does; these are the practical constraints:

| | |
|---|---|
| SoC | ESP32-P4 is verified. Other ESP-DL targets (e.g. ESP32-S3) are allowed but experimental — a warning, not a build error. See [Portability](#portability) |
| Framework | ESP-IDF (no Arduino core on these targets) |
| PSRAM | Required — the model runtime and frame buffers live here |
| Flash | `flash_size: 16MB` — the embedded model makes the app image ~2.3 MB; 16 MB lets ESPHome auto-size an app partition that fits, with no custom partition CSV |

Tested against ESPHome 2026.6.0 / ESP-IDF v5.5.4.

## Quick start

These paths use the reTerminal D1001 because it's the verified board, but the
shape is the same for any board: pull the component, give it a frame source, and
expose a sensor. For a different ESP32-P4 camera board, point `esp_video_camera`
at your sensor and pins; for another SoC, see [Portability](#portability).

### Option A — flash the prebuilt D1001 image (fastest)

Grab `reterminal-presence.factory.bin` from the [latest
release](https://github.com/zacs/esphome-person_detector/releases), flash it to
offset `0x0` (the [ESPHome web flasher](https://web.esphome.io) or
`esptool.py --chip esp32p4 write_flash 0x0 …`), then join the "reTerminal
Presence" Wi-Fi AP / captive portal (or Improv over USB) to set your network.

### Option B — start from the example config

[`example/reterminal_d1001.yaml`](example/reterminal_d1001.yaml) is a complete,
compilable D1001 config — board bring-up, camera wiring, and detector. Copy it,
drop in your Wi-Fi, and build:

```bash
pip install "esphome==2026.6.0"
esphome run example/reterminal_d1001.yaml
```

### Option C — add it to an existing ESP32-P4 config

Pull the component in, point the detector at a camera backend, and expose a
sensor. On the D1001 the camera backend is `esp_video_camera` (CSI + ISP →
RGB888); its power and reset lines sit on an XL9535 I²C expander, so copy the
`i2c:`, `xl9535:`, and `esp_video_camera:` blocks from the example for the full
wiring. The detector part is just:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://zacs/esphome-person_detector@v0.1.13   # pin a released tag
    components: [person_detect, esp_video_camera]

person_detect:
  id: presence
  frame_source_id: d1001_cam   # id of your esp_video_camera (see below)

binary_sensor:
  - platform: person_detect
    person_detect_id: presence
    name: "Room Occupied"       # device_class defaults to "occupancy"
```

A quick note on `frame_source_id` vs `camera_id`: use `frame_source_id` to point
at an `esp_video_camera` (the raw MIPI-CSI path, which is what the D1001 uses),
and `camera_id` only if you're feeding a stock ESPHome JPEG `camera:` instead.
Set exactly one — see [Frame sources](#frame-sources).

## Configuration

### `esp_video_camera:` — the ESP32-P4 MIPI-CSI backend

Owns the sensor and hands the detector upright RGB888 frames.

```yaml
esp_video_camera:
  id: d1001_cam
  sda: 37                # sensor SCCB (I²C) pins — D1001: 37/38
  scl: 38
  i2c_port: 1            # SCCB I²C controller; must differ from your `i2c:` bus
  resolution: 1280x720
  rotation: auto         # IMU-picked at boot; or pin 0 / 90 / 180 / 270
  imu:                   # only needed for rotation: auto
    i2c_id: bus_expander
    address: 0x6A        # D1001 LSM6DS3TR
  # exposure: 811        # raw sensor units; omit for a bright auto default
  # gain: 63             # raw sensor units; omit for auto
  # power/reset lines (D1001 wires these to the XL9535 expander):
  enable_pin: { xl9535: cam_expander, number: 1 }
  powerdown_pin: { xl9535: cam_expander, number: 3 }
  reset_pin: { xl9535: cam_expander, number: 11 }
```

- `rotation` accepts `auto` or an explicit `0` / `90` / `180` / `270`. Rotation
  is counter-clockwise, so `90` turns the image 90° CCW (confirmed on the D1001).
  `auto` reads the accelerometer once at boot and picks the orientation that
  keeps a standing person upright, which is handy for a device you reposition; an
  explicit value always wins and is best for a fixed mount. Auto needs the device
  roughly upright — lying flat, gravity is straight down and it holds the last
  orientation.
- `exposure` and `gain` default to a bright value because the SC2356 powers up
  near-black. If a room comes out too dark or too bright, set them (raw sensor
  units; the valid range is logged at boot).

### `person_detect:` — the detector

```yaml
person_detect:
  id: presence
  frame_source_id: d1001_cam  # an esp_video_camera; OR camera_id: for a JPEG camera
  interval: 1500ms            # inference cadence (default 1500ms, min 100ms)
  confidence_threshold: 60%   # min score to count a detection (default 60%)
  clear_after: 3              # consecutive misses before clearing (default 3)
  model: pedestrian           # selectable model (default: pedestrian)
  # advanced task tuning (defaults shown):
  task_priority: 2            # keep below a UI/LVGL task
  task_stack_size: 8192
  task_core: 1
  on_person_detected:
    - logger.log: "Person detected"
  on_person_cleared:
    - logger.log: "Room empty"
```

### `binary_sensor` / `sensor` / `switch`

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: person_detect
    person_detect_id: presence
    name: "Room Occupied"
    filters:
      - delayed_off: 15s        # optional hold-open on top of clear_after

sensor:                          # optional
  - platform: person_detect
    person_detect_id: presence
    type: confidence             # best-box score, 0–100 %
    name: "Presence Confidence"
  - platform: person_detect
    person_detect_id: presence
    type: count                  # boxes over threshold
    name: "People Count"

switch:                          # optional detection on/off (privacy)
  - platform: person_detect
    person_detect_id: presence
    name: "Presence Detection"   # on = detecting (default); off = camera idle, no inference
```

## Frame sources

`person_detect` takes frames from exactly one backend:

| Key | Backend | Frames | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frame_source_id` | `esp_video_camera` (this repo) | raw RGB888 (CSI + ISP + PPA) | ESP32-P4 MIPI-CSI sensors (SC2356 / D1001) — the path the D1001 uses |
| `camera_id` | a stock ESPHome `camera:` | JPEG, decoded on-device | a board that already exposes a JPEG camera to ESPHome |

Both sit behind one `FrameSource` seam ([`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) §2). The
`camera_id` path exists for composability, but ESPHome (as of 2026.6.0) ships no
user-configurable MIPI-CSI camera platform, so on the P4 you use
`esp_video_camera`.

## Coexisting with an LVGL / display config

Inference runs on its own low-priority, pinned FreeRTOS task (`task_priority`,
`task_core`), publishes only from the main loop, and keeps every large buffer in
PSRAM, so it stays out of the way of an 800×1280 MIPI-DSI LVGL UI. If your UI
task is pinned to a core, pin detection to the other with `task_core`.

## Tuning

- `confidence_threshold` — raise it (70–80 %) to cut false positives from
  clutter, or lower it (45–55 %) if real people are missed.
- `interval` — presence doesn't need video framerates; 1–2 s is a good default.
  Inference is ~75 ms on the P4, so the task idles most of the interval.
- `clear_after` + `delayed_off` — `clear_after` debounces single-frame misses; a
  `delayed_off:` filter adds occupancy-style hold-open.
- Exposure and lighting — the SC2356 is a small 2 MP sensor. If confidence sags
  in dim rooms, raise `exposure`/`gain`, and avoid strong backlight (a window
  behind the subject) that silhouettes people.

## Diagnostics

With `logger: level: DEBUG`, each inference logs its time, frame dimensions, box
count, best score, a min/max/mean frame-brightness probe, and free PSRAM.
`dump_config` prints the model, cadence, threshold, task placement, PSRAM
cost/low-water, last inference time, and capture-failure count. On boot,
`esp_video_camera` logs the SCCB port, the applied exposure/gain with their
ranges, and — for `rotation: auto` — the raw accelerometer reading and the
rotation it chose.

## Memory / flash budget

All large buffers live in PSRAM; internal SRAM use is limited to the inference
task stack. Measured static footprint (CI `esphome compile`, ESP32-P4, ESPHome
2026.6.0 / ESP-IDF 5.5.4, `esp_video_camera` + `person_detect` + ESP-DL +
pedestrian model):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total image | ~2.29 MB (Flash 13.6 % of 16 MB) |
| `.rodata` (model weights + const) | 596 KB |
| Internal RAM (static) | ~5.8 % of 512 KB |
| PPA / capture / tensor-arena buffers | PSRAM, allocated at runtime (not in the image) |

Runtime PSRAM depends on resolution and rotation; read it on your build from the
`model runtime PSRAM cost` (startup) and `PSRAM free low-water` (`dump_config`)
log lines. Roughly: model weights go in flash; the ESP-DL tensor arena, the
RGB888 frame (1280×720 ≈ 2.6 MB), and camera buffers go in PSRAM; the task stack
is internal SRAM.

## How it works

`PersonDetector` pulls one typed RGB frame per `interval` from a `FrameSource`
(on a dedicated low-priority FreeRTOS task), runs the ESP-DL model on it (resized
to the model input via the P4's hardware image path), and marshals the result to
the main loop for debouncing, state publishing, and triggers. See
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the full design and [`BRINGUP.md`](BRINGUP.md) for a
first-flash checklist.

## Portability

The detector is SoC-agnostic by design: it consumes frames through a pluggable
`FrameSource`, and the ESP-DL model runs on the ESP32-S3 as well as the P4. Only
the ESP32-P4 path is verified, so on other targets `person_detect` warns rather
than blocking at compile time.

What's P4-specific is the `esp_video_camera` backend — it uses the P4's MIPI-CSI
controller, ISP, and PPA, which no other ESP32 has, so it hard-fails elsewhere.
To run on an S3, feed frames through `camera_id` instead: a JPEG ESPHome camera
such as an OV2640/OV3660 over DVP (see ESPHome's `esp32_camera` component). That
path exists behind the same seam but isn't hardware-verified yet — expect slower
inference, no hardware rotation, and some bring-up. Contributions to verify it
are welcome.

## Extending

The component is layered so contributors can add support without touching the core:

- A detection model — a row in the `MODELS` table plus a `case` in
  `PersonDetector::create_model_()` (`components/person_detect/`); any ESP-DL
  detector returning `dl::detect::result_t` boxes fits.
- A camera sensor — a `sensor:` enum entry and its `esp_cam_sensor` Kconfig in
  `components/esp_video_camera/__init__.py`; the capture/PPA path is
  sensor-independent.
- A frame-source backend — implement `person_detect::FrameSource`
  (`frame_source.h`) and yield `FrameView`s; the detector consumes them unchanged.
- A board — a device YAML with its `esp32:` details, camera wiring, and a
  `person_detect` block. The D1001 files under `example/` and `firmware/` are the
  first; others sit alongside them.

Contributions for new models, sensors, and boards are welcome.
